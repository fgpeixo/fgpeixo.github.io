# Introduction

A few days ago I have been requested to review a few requirements for a new application and it seemed like a good oportunity to explore Restful ABAP Programming Model (RAP) Side Effects.
I had studied about Side Effects in RAP context before, so I was aware of its use cases, however I had not implemented it in a real project.
As the system I am working on at the moment is an on-premisse S/4HANA 2021 installation, I had to first understand from which version of the on-premise S/4HANA it is available.
To my disapointment, Side Effects for RAP are only available in on-premisse installations from S/4HANA 2023 [ABAP Platform Fiori Elements Features Showcase](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-fiori-feature-showcase/blob/main/04_object_page_general.md#side-effects).

In this post, I will explore how to work with Side Effects in S/4HANA 2021.
